# Example App

This is an example directory structure showing how apps should be organized according to AGENTS.md guidelines.

Each Issue's app should follow this pattern:
- Located in `apps/issue-[id]/`
- Has its own README.md
- Has its own CI/CD workflow at `.github/workflows/ci_[id].yml`

For actual implementations, replace "example" with the actual issue ID (e.g., "issue-1").
